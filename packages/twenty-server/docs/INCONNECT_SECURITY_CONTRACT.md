## Purpose and Licensing Boundary

INCONNECT is an independent OSS record-authorization and commercial-team implementation built on Twenty OSS. Its operating model is:

- Executive: own records.
- Coordinator: own records plus records owned by members of the coordinator's commercial team.
- Supervisor: all records, subject to Twenty standard permissions.
- Admin: all records, subject to Twenty standard permissions.

Lead and Folio ISO are the currently managed custom objects, but the engine is metadata-driven and must remain generic. Never hardcode their names, physical tables, owner columns, workspace IDs, Role IDs, or Workspace Member IDs.

The Enterprise boundary is strict:

- Never copy, derive, adapt, reuse, or inspect Twenty Enterprise Row-Level Permissions for INCONNECT design or implementation.
- Never modify `engine/core-modules/enterprise/**` for this project.
- Never import Enterprise RLS predicates, evaluators, renderers, builders, metadata entities, migrations, or tests.
- OSS shared infrastructure may be reused when appropriate.
- Keep INCONNECT an independently designed OSS implementation under the INCONNECT module and OSS ORM integration points.

INCONNECT operational configuration is not a syncable metadata entity. Do not start a `syncable-entity-*` workflow unless a future task explicitly introduces a real syncable metadata entity and justifies it.

## Contract: Security Model

Record effects:

- `ownRecords`
- `ownAndTeamRecords`
- `allRecords`

Effective authorization is always:

    Twenty standard permissions
    AND INCONNECT operation policy
    AND INCONNECT record scope
    AND INCONNECT owner integrity, when configured

`allRecords` only omits an additional INCONNECT row predicate. It never bypasses standard object or field permissions.

Strict behavior:

- Managed object plus Role without exactly one applicable Policy: denied.
- Duplicate, invalid, incomplete, corrupt, or unavailable authoritative policy/cache: denied.
- Human policy requiring a Workspace Member with no authenticated Workspace Member: denied.
- Object not managed by INCONNECT: standard Twenty behavior.
- `system` bypass is reserved only for explicitly authorized internal operations already trusted by Twenty.
- Unsupported managed-object write paths remain fail-closed unless a later phase explicitly designs and tests them.

The resolved decision model distinguishes `not-managed`, `system-bypass`, `denied`, `all-records`, and `owner-workspace-member-ids`. Scoped decisions keep two independent sets:

- `recordScopeOwnerWorkspaceMemberIds`: owners whose existing records the actor may access.
- `assignableOwnerWorkspaceMemberIds`: owners that may receive a new record or transfer when operation policy permits.

Never cache a complete actor-specific decision by only workspace + Role. Policy snapshots and Team maps may be workspace-level; authenticated Workspace Member and owner-ID decisions must be resolved per request.

## Contract: SQL Enforcement

Authorization is enforced in backend SQL, never by frontend filtering or post-filtering.

Reads cover the protected ORM v1 and ORM v2 paths, including:

- list/find-many and direct find-by-ID/find-one;
- count and pagination;
- Search through the existing FTS/ILIKE pipelines;
- protected raw/select execution paths;
- relations and managed `JOIN ... ON` targets.

Predicates preserve grouping:

    OWNER_SCOPE AND (USER_FILTER)

A managed joined object receives its own scope. An accessible Lead must not expose an inaccessible related Folio ISO, and vice versa.

Writes cover the supported common Create/Update/Delete-style builders:

- Current-owner scope is part of the same mutation SQL predicate, preventing permission-check-then-write TOCTOU.
- Owner transfer validates both current-record scope and destination-owner policy.
- Client-provided owner values remain subject to Twenty standard owner-field permission.
- Security-injected owner defaults do not grant client permission to edit the owner field.
- UUIDs are parameters and owner columns/tables are derived from metadata.
- Direct-by-ID operations outside scope behave as not found/no affected rows without existence disclosure.
- Internal provenance for `createdBy`/`updatedBy` remains protected and only explicitly tracked system side effects may bypass client field-write checks.

The following generic EntityManager/Repository operations remain fail-closed for managed objects unless explicitly expanded later:

- `upsert`
- `merge`
- `save`
- `remove`
- `softRemove`
- `recover`

Do not move enforcement into individual REST/GraphQL resolvers; preserve the common ORM/query-builder coverage.

## Operation Policies and Owner Integrity

Create policy values:

- `denied`
- `defaultOwner`
- `assignableOwners`
- `standardPermissionsOnly`

Owner-transfer policy values:

- `denied`
- `assignableOwners`
- `standardPermissionsOnly`

These are independent of `recordEffect`. Twenty shares `canUpdateObjectRecords` between Create and Update, so INCONNECT intentionally adds a separate Create dimension.

Owner requirement values:

- `required`
- `optional`

Missing-owner policy values:

- `self`
- `requireExplicit`
- `singleActiveMemberOfRole`
- `standard`

Owner omission and explicit null are distinct. When owner is required:

- explicit null on Create: denied;
- explicit null on Update: denied;
- omitted owner: resolved according to `missingOwnerPolicy`.

Normalization covers relation values, normalized FK values, relation objects, nested connect, and equivalent representations reaching the common write pipeline. Contradictory relation/FK owner inputs are denied. Owner join columns are derived with Twenty metadata helpers.

For `singleActiveMemberOfRole`, the default is a Role reference, never a hardcoded person:

- 0 active candidates: Create without owner denied.
- 1 active candidate: use that Workspace Member.
- 2 or more active candidates: Create without owner denied.

## Current Functional Policies

### Lead

- Ejecutivo INCONNECT: `ownRecords`, Create denied, transfer denied, owner required, missing owner `requireExplicit`.
- Coordinador INCONNECT: `ownAndTeamRecords`, Create denied, transfer denied, owner required, missing owner `requireExplicit`.
- Supervisor INCONNECT: `allRecords`, standard Create/transfer, owner required, missing owner `singleActiveMemberOfRole`, default Role Supervisor INCONNECT.
- Admin: `allRecords`, standard Create/transfer, owner required, same Supervisor default.

### Folio ISO

- Ejecutivo INCONNECT: `ownRecords`, Create `defaultOwner`, missing owner `self`, transfer denied, owner required.
- Coordinador INCONNECT: `ownAndTeamRecords`, Create `defaultOwner`, missing owner `self`, transfer denied, owner required.
- Supervisor INCONNECT: `allRecords`, standard Create/transfer, missing owner `self`, owner required.
- Admin: `allRecords`, standard Create/transfer, missing owner `self`, owner required.

Twenty creates a Folio ISO immediately when opening a new record, so all configured Roles use self for an omitted Folio owner. Supervisor/Admin may transfer it later only when standard permissions permit. Lead and Folio ISO owners are independent; there is no inherited Lead-to-Folio access or automatic owner synchronization.

## Commercial Teams

Persisted entities/tables:

- `InconnectCommercialTeamEntity` / `core.inconnectCommercialTeam`
- `InconnectCommercialTeamMembershipEntity` / `core.inconnectCommercialTeamMembership`

Membership types:

- `COORDINATOR`
- `EXECUTIVE`

Invariants:

- A Workspace Member has at most one active commercial-team membership.
- A Team has at most one active Coordinator.
- Team and membership references are workspace-isolated.
- Roles determine the type of record-access policy; Team membership determines which Workspace Members expand `ownAndTeamRecords`. They are independent dimensions.
- A historical/non-assignable member may remain in record scope but must not be an assignment destination.
- Workspace Member validity/assignability uses active Workspace Member, UserWorkspace, User, and supported non-disabled status checks.

The security-sensitive Team cache provides workspace-level maps for membership, record scope, and assignable destinations. It uses:

- read-only `REPEATABLE READ` snapshots;
- runtime payload/version validation;
- strict shared Redis authority;
- shared-generation validation before trusting local state;
- generation fencing/CAS;
- stale recomputation protection;
- fail-closed absent/invalid/corrupt/recomputation-failed states;
- after-commit invalidation and recomputation;
- multi-process protection and deterministic lock ordering.

Authorization uses Team maps only for `ownAndTeamRecords`. `ownRecords` and `allRecords` do not depend on Team cache availability.

Commercial Teams administration is complete:

- Settings API lists Teams and available Workspace Members and exposes create, rename, assign/change Coordinator, add/remove Executive, atomic move Executive, and delete Team.
- Every mutation derives workspace from authenticated context, uses existing Team services, and is protected by `WorkspaceAuthGuard` plus `SettingsPermissionGuard(PermissionFlagType.SECURITY)`.
- Settings UI is available at Settings -> Security -> Commercial Teams.
- UI and API never change Roles when memberships change.
- Administrative reads use PostgreSQL authority; runtime authorization uses the hardened Team cache.
- Mutation results distinguish `recomputed` from `recomputation-failed`.
- Pre-commit revoke/validation/locking/DB failure rejects the mutation with no commit.
- Post-commit recomputation failure reports successful persistence plus `recomputation-failed`; runtime remains fail-closed until cache recovery.

Do not redesign Commercial Teams while changing Record Access persistence unless a concrete security requirement demands it.

## Persisted Record Access Authority

Persisted core model:

    inconnectRecordAccessConfiguration
      -> inconnectRecordAccessManagedObject
           -> inconnectRecordAccessPolicy

Configuration stores workspace, `MANAGED | UNMANAGED`, bigint revision represented as a TypeScript string, and timestamps. Managed Object stores ObjectMetadata, owner FieldMetadata, and owner requirement. Policy stores Role, principal type, record effect, operation policies, missing-owner policy, and optional default-owner Role.

Real IDs/FKs are persisted authority. Universal identifiers are used only at import/export/API boundaries. Composite reference keys enforce strong workspace isolation:

- Role: `(id, workspaceId)`
- ObjectMetadata: `(id, workspaceId)`
- FieldMetadata: `(id, objectMetadataId, workspaceId)`

The owner Field FK physically guarantees same Field -> Object -> Workspace. Runtime validation additionally requires live metadata, RELATION, MANY_TO_ONE, Workspace Member target, and derivable join column. A Managed Object with zero Policies remains managed and denies all human Roles. `MANAGED` with zero Managed Objects is invalid/fail-closed. `UNMANAGED` must have no children.

The persistence DDL is the Fast Instance Command:

`packages/twenty-server/src/database/commands/upgrade-version-command/2-32/2-32-instance-command-fast-1786740000000-create-inconnect-record-access-persistence.ts`

It has been executed and audited in local development. Other environments must run their own authorized upgrade process; local execution never affects production.

## Source Modes and Policy Cache

`INCONNECT_RECORD_ACCESS_SOURCE_MODE` supports:

### `env` (default)

- Uses only `INCONNECT_RECORD_ACCESS_CONFIG`.
- Does not require the DB policy cache.

### `transition`

- DB Configuration absent: legacy ENV.
- DB Configuration present: DB claims full workspace authority.
- Once claimed, invalid DB/cache or failed recomputation denies; never fall back to ENV.

### `database`

- Uses DB only.
- Configuration absent: denied.
- Valid `MANAGED`: persisted policy enforcement.
- Valid `UNMANAGED`: standard Twenty behavior.
- Never falls back to ENV.

ENV and DB normalize into the same `InconnectRecordAccessWorkspacePolicy`; ORM enforcement does not know the source.

The security-sensitive DB policy cache is workspace-level and uses runtime decoding/versioning, a read-only `REPEATABLE READ` DB snapshot, strict Redis generation validation on security retrieval, generation fencing/CAS, multi-instance protection, and fail-closed cache states. It never caches actor-specific owner IDs. Redis failure is irrelevant in `env` mode but denies when transition/database needs DB authority.

Configuration publication is complete:

- `replaceConfiguration` replaces the whole active set transactionally.
- First publication uses `expectedRevision = null` and produces revision 1.
- Later publication locks Configuration `FOR UPDATE`, requires exact bigint-string revision, and increments it.
- Concurrent/stale publication conflicts instead of last-write-wins.
- Cache generation is revoked before DB authority changes.
- Rollback after revoke attempts to recompute the previous state; failure remains fail-closed.
- Recompute occurs after commit and is generation-fenced.
- Post-commit recomputation failure does not pretend DB rollback; it returns persisted success with fail-closed cache status.
- The ENV importer supports dry-run and guarded initial publication, resolving universal identifiers to workspace-local IDs through the same candidate validator.

## Record Access Settings

Settings -> Security -> Record Access is complete.

Backend:

- `getInconnectRecordAccessConfiguration`
- `getInconnectRecordAccessAvailableMetadata`
- `replaceInconnectRecordAccessConfiguration(input)`

The API derives workspace from authenticated context, uses PostgreSQL as the administrative read authority, publishes only through `replaceConfiguration`, and is protected by `WorkspaceAuthGuard` plus `SettingsPermissionGuard(PermissionFlagType.SECURITY)`. It distinguishes ABSENT, MANAGED, and UNMANAGED and returns revision plus cache status.

Frontend:

- Uses backend-provided valid Objects, owner Fields, and Roles; it does not reconstruct security metadata rules.
- Edits a local full-set draft and publishes only on Save.
- Uses optimistic revision and surfaces conflicts without retry/overwrite.
- Warns before MANAGED -> UNMANAGED and Managed Object removal.
- Preserves Managed Object with zero Policies and shows its fail-closed meaning.
- Distinguishes DB persistence success from cache recomputation failure.
- Refetches normalized PostgreSQL state after publication.

Administrative visibility is controlled by `PermissionFlagType.SECURITY` in both frontend navigation and backend guards; backend remains authoritative. Record Access policy administration and Commercial Team administration are separate domains.

## Contract: Security Foundation

### Public Record Access Facade

`InconnectRecordAccessAuthorizationService` is implemented at `packages/twenty-server/src/engine/core-modules/inconnect-record-access/services/inconnect-record-access-authorization.service.ts` and exported by `InconnectRecordAccessModule`. Its public API is:

- `resolveReadScope`
- `applyReadScopeToQueryBuilder`
- `isRecordReadable`
- `buildAuthorizedRecordExistsCondition`
- `isAuthenticatedWorkspaceMemberValid`

Core consumers receive only the public scopes `not-managed`, `system-bypass`, `denied`, `all-records`, and `owner-scoped`. The facade encapsulates raw policies, Redis/cache payloads, Team maps, owner parsing, ENV/database source internals, renderers, and generation fencing. `not-managed` means only that INCONNECT adds no record predicate; it is not authorization and never bypasses Twenty standard permissions. Invalid or unavailable actor, workspace, metadata, policy, cache, or required Team authority denies.
